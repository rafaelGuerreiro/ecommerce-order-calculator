##Important note

**This software is supposed to run on ruby >= 2.1**

###Installing

- Clone this repository in a desired folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/rafaelGuerreiro/ecommerce-order-calculator.git
```

- Move into the new folder using `cd ecommerce-order-calculator`
- Install required gems using `bundle install`

###Running

- Locate the csv files needed to run this software. Let's assume that they are in your Desktop:
  - /Users/your-user/Desktop/coupons.csv
  - /Users/your-user/Desktop/products.csv
  - /Users/your-user/Desktop/orders.csv
  - /Users/your-user/Desktop/order_items.csv

- To execute this software, run the following command:
```
./app.rb /Users/your-user/Desktop/coupons /Users/your-user/Desktop/products /Users/your-user/Desktop/orders /Users/your-user/Desktop/order_items /Users/your-user/Desktop/result
```
You can also run the above command using relative paths.

So, if you placed the `ecommerce-order-calculator` in your Desktop as well, it would be like this:
```
./app.rb ../coupons ../products.csv ../orders ../order_items.csv ../result
```
As you might have noticed, the `.csv` extension is optional when you're executing `app.rb`

- Check the `result.csv` generated by the software.

####Issues

- If you forget to inform one CSV file, the software will complaint about it.
```
FATAL ERROR => You have to provide 5 paths for the program be able to continue.
The order of models being used is: [Coupon, Product, Order, OrderProduct, :result]
```

- Your user have to have writing permissions to the target directory so the software can run correctly.
